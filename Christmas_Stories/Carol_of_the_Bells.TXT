Hark how the bells,
Sweet silver bells,
All seem to say,
"Throw cares away!"

Christmas is here,
Bringing good cheer,
To young and old,
Meek and the bold.

Ding dong ding dong
That is their song
With joyful ring
All caroling.

One seems to hear
Words of good cheer
From ev'rywhere
Filling the air.

O, how they pound,
Raising the sound,
O'er hill and dale,
Telling their tale.

Gaily they ring
While people sing
Songs of good cheer,
Christmas is here.

Merry, Merry, Merry, 
Merry Christmas!
Merry, Merry, Merry, 
Merry Christmas!

Onward they send,
On without end,
Their joyful tone
To ev'ry home:
