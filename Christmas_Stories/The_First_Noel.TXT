The first Noel, the angels say
To Bethlehem's shepherds as they lay.
At midnight watch, when keeping sheep,
The winter wild, the light snow deep.

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel.

The shepherds rose, and saw a star
Bright in the East, beyond them far,
Its beauty gave them great delight,
This star it set now day nor night.

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel.

Now by the light of this bright star
Three wise men came from country far;
They sought a king, such their intent,
The star their guide where'er it went.

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel.

Then drawing nigh to the northwest,
O'er Bethlehem town it took its rest;
The wise men learnt its cause of stay,
And found the place where Jesus lay.

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel.
